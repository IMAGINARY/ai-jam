# Some general definitions / theory

## LSTM

- Long Short Term Memory networks â€“ are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies.

## RNNs

- The LSTM is a particular type of recurrent network that works slightly better in practice, owing to its more powerful update equation and some appealing backpropagation dynamics
